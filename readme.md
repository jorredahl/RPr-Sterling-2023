## Abstract

This study is a *reproduction* of Charles W. Sterling III et al's study on "Connections Between Present-Day Water Access and Historical Redlining":

> Sterling III, Charles W., et al. "Connections between present-day water access and historical redlining." Environmental Justice (2023). [doi.org/10.1089/env.2022.0115](https://doi.org/10.1089/env.2022.0115)

This study uses ACS Census data and historical HOLC records of neighborhoods to examine the correlation of historical redlining and current-day access to water in cities. The study uses a binary logistic regression to identify relationships of different demographic and HOLC varaibles to access to water and sewage. The study finds that historically worse HOLC scores were correlated with less access to water in cities across all regions of the United States.

## Compendium structure and contents

This research compendium is structured with four main directories:

- `data`: contains subdirectories for `raw` data and `derived` data.
- `docs`: contains subdirectories for `manuscript`, `presentation`, and `report`
- `procedure`: contains subdirectories for `code` or software scripts, information about the computational `environment` in which the research was conducted, and non-code research `protocols`
- `results`: contains subdirectories for `figures`, formatted data `tables`, or `other` formats of research results.

The data, procedures, and results of this repository are outlined in three tables:
- Data: [data/data_index.csv](data/data_index.csv)
- Procedures: [procedure/procedure_index.csv](procedure/procedure_index.csv)
- Results: [results/results_index.csv](results/results_index.csv)

Important local **documents** include:
