# Abstract

This study is a *reproduction* of Charles W. Sterling III et al's study on "Connections Between Present-Day Water Access and Historical Redlining":

> Sterling III, Charles W., et al. "Connections between present-day water access and historical redlining." Environmental Justice (2023). DOI:[10.1089/env.2022.0115](https://doi.org/10.1089/env.2022.0115)

This study uses ACS Census data and historical HOLC records of neighborhoods to examine the correlation of historical redlining and current-day access to water in cities. The study uses a binary logistic regression to identify relationships of different demographic and HOLC varaibles to access to water and sewage. The study finds that historically worse HOLC scores were correlated with less access to water in cities across all regions of the United States.

# Materials and procedure

## Computational environment

```{r environment-setup, include = FALSE}
# record all the packages you are using here
# this includes any calls to library(), require(),
# and double colons such as here::i_am()
packages <- c("tidyverse", "here")

# force all conflicts to become errors
# if you load dplyr and use filter(), R has to guess whether you mean dplyr::filter() or stats::filter()
# the conflicted package forces you to be explicit about this
# disable at your own peril
# https://conflicted.r-lib.org/
require(conflicted)

# load and install required packages
# https://groundhogr.com/
if (!require(groundhog)) {
  install.packages("groundhog")
  require(groundhog)
}

# this date will be used to determine the versions of R and your packages
# it is best practice to keep R and its packages up to date
groundhog.day <- "2023-06-26"

# this replaces any library() or require() calls
groundhog.library(packages, groundhog.day)
# you may need to install a correct version of R
# you may need to respond OK in the console to permit groundhog to install packages
# you may need to restart R and rerun this code to load installed packages
# In RStudio, restart r with Session -> Restart Session

# record the R processing environment
# alternatively, use devtools::session_info() for better results

See acs_values.csv at `/data/raw/public/acs_values.csv`

### HOLC Grades

 `Title`: HOLC grades from the Mapping Inequality Database (MID)
- `Abstract`: HOLC grades are historical neighborhood delineations created by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation in the 1930s to assess mortgage lending risk. These maps were used to guide investment and disinvestment in urban areas
 and are a foundational dataset for understanding redlining and its long-term impacts.
- `Spatial Coverage`: Select major U.S. cities
- `Spatial Resolution`: Neighborhood-scale boundaries (city block to district level, variable by city)
- `Spatial Representation Type`: `vector`, `MULTIPOLYGON`
- `Spatial Reference System`: `NAD83`
- `Temporal Coverage`: 1935–1940 (approximate dates of HOLC map creation)
- `Temporal Resolution`: Single mapping effort. 
- `Lineage`: Downloaded and used as-is.
- `Distribution`: Data is publically avalible from the Mapping Inequality website (https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/data)[https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/data]
- `Constraints`: Publically avalible data.
- `Data Quality`: Accurate to the degree that the original digitization of the 1930's HOLC maps was accurate.

## Prior observations  

There are no prior observations related with this data.

## Bias and threats to validity

Two main source of bias in this study come from the HOLC data itself, while another comes from the ACS data. Firstly, the spatial extent of the HOLC data only covers the centers of major cities across the united states, limiting the analysis to center-cities. Secondly, Areal Interpolation was used to determine a HOLC grade for each block group, meaning that while a single grade can be determined, there may be some errors in block groups crossing over historic neighborhood boundaries. Additionally, it's unclear how this areal interpolation was done. Lastly, there could be a difference in results if an areal unit other than census block groups were used to perform this analysis.

## Data transformations

Describe all data transformations planned to prepare data sources for analysis.
This section should explain with the fullest detail possible how to transform data from the **raw** state at the time of acquisition or observation, to the pre-processed **derived** state ready for the main analysis.
Including steps to check and mitigate sources of **bias** and **threats to validity**.
The method may anticipate **contingencies**, e.g. tests for normality and alternative decisions to make based on the results of the test.
More specifically, all the **geographic** and **variable** transformations required to prepare input data as described in the data and variables section above to match the study's spatio-temporal characteristics as described in the study metadata and study design sections.
Visual workflow diagrams may help communicate the methodology in this section.

Examples of **geographic** transformations include coordinate system transformations, aggregation, disaggregation, spatial interpolation, distance calculations, zonal statistics, etc.

Examples of **variable** transformations include standardization, normalization, constructed variables, imputation, classification, etc.

Be sure to include any steps planned to **exclude** observations with *missing* or *outlier* data, to **group** observations by *attribute* or *geographic* criteria, or to **impute** missing data or apply spatial or temporal **interpolation**.

## Analysis

Sterling III's original study used a binary logistic regression model to compare categorical hold grades and a census block group's binary desigantion of whether plumbing rates were above or below average. Results were gathered as the Average Marginal Effects (AME) of different census-derived varaibles represented as binary values.

# Results

Data is presented as 3 figures, 2 tables, and 7 supplementary tables:

Figures:

- Map of HOLC grades for different cities across regions
- Correlation plot for potential predictive variables
- Map of percent of houses with incomplete plumbing  across regions

Tables:

- Average Marginal Effects of Variables determined by Binary Regression Model
- The Number of Each Grade Polygon in Each Data Set

Supplementary Tables:

- The results of the Dunn Test to determine whether incomplete plumbing % in Grade A is significantly different than the other Grades
- The average % for each predictive variable broken down by HOLC grade and region
- AME Table for the Nation using the average 2.61168 as the threshold for the binary variable
National
- AME Table for the Northeast region using the average 1.447623 as the threshold for the binary variable
- AME Table for the South region using the average 3.414391 as the threshold for the binary variable
- AME Table for the Midwest region using the average 3.756471 as the threshold for the binary variable
- AME Table for the West region using the average 0.7836609 as the threshold for the binary variable

# Discussion

Sterling III hypothesizes that areas of present-day incomplete plumbing within U.S. cities (i.e., communities with a proportion of homes lacking complete plumbing above the national average) are significantly associated with HOLC neighborhood designations. The study finds evidence for this hypothesis.

A successful reproduction would confirm this hypothesis with similar derived values to those found in the original study.

# Integrity Statement

The authors of this preregistration state that they completed this preregistration to the best of their knowledge and that no other preregistration exists pertaining to the same hypotheses and research.
