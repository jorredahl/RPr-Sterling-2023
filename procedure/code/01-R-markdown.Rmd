# Abstract

This study is a *reproduction* of Charles W. Sterling III et al's study on "Connections Between Present-Day Water Access and Historical Redlining".

> Sterling III, Charles W., et al. "Connections between present-day water access and historical redlining." Environmental Justice (2023). DOI:[10.1089/env.2022.0115](https://doi.org/10.1089/env.2022.0115)

This study uses ACS Census data and historical HOLC records of neighborhoods to examine the correlation of historical redlining and current-day access to water in cities. 
The study uses a binary logistic regression to identify relationships of different demographic and HOLC varaibles to access to water and sewage. 
The study finds that historically worse HOLC scores were correlated with less access to water in cities across all regions of the United States.

# Study design

Describe how the study relates to prior literature, e.g. is it a **original study**, **meta-analysis study**, **reproduction study**, **reanalysis study**, or **replication study**?

Also describe the original study archetype, e.g. is it **observational**, **experimental**, **quasi-experimental**, or **exploratory**?

Enumerate specific **hypotheses** to be tested or **research questions** to be investigated here, and specify the type of method, statistical test or model to be used on the hypothesis or question.

This study is a *reproduction* of Charles W. Sterling III et al's study on "Connections Between Present-Day Water Access and Historical Redlining", a study which set out to 
explore the relationship between prevalence of the `complete plumbing` ACS variable in census blocks and historical neighborhood HOLC grades. In the study, Sterling hypothesizes that there will be a link
between HOLC grade and complete plumbing. This hypothesis is based on the HOLC's well documented history of assigning neighborhoods of color the lowest grades and previous findings
of a nationwide link between race and complete plumbing prevalance as found in Deitz and Meehan 2019. Sterling's work uses similar method to this study, using a logistic regression to test the link between the neighborhood grades and plumbing. 

Other methods included in this study include the use of Areal Interpolation to supposedly assign ACS variable characteristics to the HOLC graded neighborhoods. 
This is somewhat of a strange strategy; often used to fill in missing or anamolous values in gridded data, areal interpolation doesn't make a lot of sense 
for something like assigning data to an irregularly shaped polygon. Furthermore, areal interpolation assigns a value that is a average of several values of the areal units on either side of it.
This suggests that the phenomena to be studied in the filled in area is a continuation of patterns that are present proximal to it. This is almost the opposite of the point of HOLC grades,
grades assigned to neighborhoods based on their characteristics that set them apart. There's a somewhat simple explanation to why Sterling chose to use this approach; The study that Sterling cites as the published usage of this technique for re-aggregating HOLC data - Fricker and Allen 2022 - used 
area-weighted-reaggregation to re-assign casualties from tornado paths to the neighborhoods they passed through, but incorrectly used the term 'areal interpolation' to describe their method. This means that likely Sterling also just used AWR. This assumption is supported by an interrogation of the python package used for the 
reaggregation, which considers AWR "the simplest form of areal interpolation", a somewhat misleading designation given that the two refer to different techniques.

*Unplanned Deviation* This study uses block group-level data for the foreign-born population. However, the ACS datasets have no information about place-of-birth at this level. Instead, data for foreign-born population percentage is gathered at the tract level.

### HOLC Grades

 `Title`: HOLC grades from the Mapping Inequality Database (MID)
- `Abstract`: HOLC grades are historical neighborhood delineations created by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation in the 1930s to assess mortgage lending risk. These maps were used to guide investment and disinvestment in urban areas
 and are a foundational dataset for understanding redlining and its long-term impacts.
- `Spatial Coverage`: Select major U.S. cities
- `Spatial Resolution`: Neighborhood-scale boundaries (city block to district level, variable by city)
- `Spatial Representation Type`: `vector`, `MULTIPOLYGON`
- `Spatial Reference System`: `NAD83`
- `Temporal Coverage`: 1935–1940 (approximate dates of HOLC map creation)
- `Temporal Resolution`: Single mapping effort. 
- `Lineage`: Downloaded and used as-is.
- `Distribution`: Data is avalible on the Mapping Inequality website (https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/data)[https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/data]
- `Constraints`: Publicly available data under a [CC-by-NC 2.5 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/deed.en)
- `Data Quality`: Accurate to the degree that the original digitization of the 1930's HOLC maps was accurate.

*Unplanned Deviation* Not all HOLC polygons have valid geometry, so invalid geometry was fixed by splitting to single parts before performing the intersects function

```{r Collect-HOLC}
holc_polygons<- st_read(here("data", "raw", "public", "mappinginequality.gpkg"), layer = "mappinginequality", quiet = TRUE)
holc_polygons<- st_transform(holc_polygons, 4269)

holc_polygons_fixed <- st_make_valid(holc_polygons)

holc_polygons_fixed$isvalid <- st_is_valid(holc_polygons)

holc_polygons_bugged <- holc_polygons_fixed |>
  dplyr::filter(isvalid == FALSE)

holc_polygons_fixed <- holc_polygons_fixed |>
  dplyr::filter(isvalid == TRUE)

holc_polygons_singlepart <- st_cast(holc_polygons_bugged, "POLYGON")

holc_polygons_singlepart <- st_make_valid(holc_polygons_singlepart)

holc_polygons_singlepart$isvalid <- st_is_valid(holc_polygons_singlepart)

holc_polygons_singlepart <- holc_polygons_singlepart |>
  dplyr::filter(isvalid == TRUE)

holc_polygons_fixed <- holc_polygons_fixed |>
  rbind(holc_polygons_singlepart)
```

In order to first save data, the tract and census block data should first be intersected by these HOLC polygons

```{r Clip-acs}
if (!file.exists(here('data','raw','public','acs_censusblock.gpkg')) & !file.exists(here('data','raw','public','acs_tract.gpkg'))) {
  cb_intersection_indeces <- st_intersects(st_make_valid(st_as_sf(acs_cb)), holc_polygons_fixed)
  
  t_intersection_indeces <- st_intersects(st_as_sf(acs_t), holc_polygons_fixed)
  
  cb_non_empty_indeces <- which(lengths(cb_intersection_indeces) > 0)
  cb_intersects <- acs_cb[cb_non_empty_indeces, ]
  
  t_non_empty_indeces <- which(lengths(t_intersection_indeces) > 0)
  t_intersects <- acs_t[t_non_empty_indeces, ]
}
```

```{r rejoin-holc}
holc_polygons_fixed <- holc_polygons_fixed |>
    group_by(area_id,city,state,city_survey,category,grade,label,residential,commercial,industrial,fill) |>
    summarize(geom = st_union(geom))
```

```{r write-census-public}
if (!file.exists(here('data','raw','public','acs_censusblock.gpkg')) & !file.exists(here('data','raw','public','acs_tract.gpkg'))) {
  cb_intersects |> write_sf(here('data','raw','public','acs_censusblock.gpkg'))
  
  t_intersects |> write_sf(here('data','raw','public','acs_tract.gpkg'))
}
```

```{r load acs data public}
cb_intersects<- st_read(here('data','raw','public','acs_censusblock.gpkg'))
t_intersects<- st_read(here('data','raw','public','acs_tract.gpkg'))
```
## Prior observations  

There are no prior observations related with this data.

## Bias and threats to validity

Three main source of bias in this study come from the HOLC data itself.
Firstly, the spatial extent of the HOLC data only covers the centers of major cities across the united states, limiting the analysis to center-cities. 
Secondly, 'Areal Interpolation' was used to determine census data values for each HOLC neighborhood, a method that doesn't seem logical or advisable give the study context. Some data in the study suggests that this actually was a more logical area weighted reaggregation.
Choosing individual HOLC polygons as the study's resolution increases the threat to validity through the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. Many of the polygons represent outdated neighborhood lines, and are limited only to populated areas from that time period. This affects the data being used to represent each neighborhood today, especially considering that area-weighted reaggregation is being used.

## Data transformations

First, remap ACS values from block groups to HOLC polygons through areal interpolation, likely actually area-weighted reaggregation. 

```{r intersection sf}
cb_intersects <- cb_intersects |>
  mutate(area = st_area(geom),
         row = row_number())

t_intersects <- t_intersects |>
  mutate(area = st_area(geom),
         row = row_number())

holc_polygons_fixed$row <- 1:nrow(holc_polygons_fixed)

cb_intersection_indeces_2 <- st_intersects(cb_intersects, holc_polygons_fixed)

all_clip_cb <- list()

for (i in cb_intersects$row) {
  holc_curr <- cb_intersection_indeces_2[[i]]
  
  holc_filtered <- holc_polygons_fixed |>
    dplyr::filter(row %in% holc_curr)
  
  cb_filtered <- cb_intersects |>
    dplyr::filter(row == i)
  
  cb_clip_st <- st_intersection(cb_filtered, holc_filtered)
  
  all_clip_cb[[length(all_clip_cb) + 1]] <- cb_clip_st
  
  message(i)
}

templist1 <- all_clip_cb

while (length(templist1) > 1) {
  templist2 <- list()
  
  for (i in (1:((length(templist1) + 1)/2))) {
    if ((2 * i) <= length(templist1)) {
      templist2[[length(templist2) + 1]] <- rbind(templist1[[2 * i - 1]], templist1[[2 * i]])
    } else {
      templist2[[length(templist2) + 1]] <- templist1[[2 * i - 1]]
    }
    
    message(i)
  }
  
  templist1 <- templist2
}

cb_clipped <- st_as_sf(templist1[[1]])

cb_clipped |>
  write_sf(here('data','raw','public','acs_censusblock_intersected.gpkg'))

```

```{r area-weighted reaggregation}
cb_clipped <- st_read(here('data', 'raw', 'public', 'acs_censusblock_intersected.gpkg'))

cb_clipped <- cb_clipped |>
  dplyr::filter(
    st_geometry_type(cb_clipped) %in% c("POLYGON")  #selecting only the polygon geometries
  )

cb_clipped <- cb_clipped |>
  mutate(area_clipped = st_area(geom))|>
  mutate(awr = as.numeric(area_clipped/area))

scaled_cb_clipped <- cb_clipped |>
  mutate(across(3:62, ~ as.numeric(.x) * as.numeric(awr)))

HOLC_polygons <- scaled_cb_clipped %>%
  group_by(area_id, grade) %>%
  summarize(across(3:62, sum, na.rm = TRUE),       
            geometry = st_union(geom)) %>%     
  ungroup()

plot(HOLC_polygons)
```

After performing AWR on the HOLC polygons, we are left with significantly less geometries than we started with (10154 originally vs. 9614 after re-aggregation). This will come into play later down the road. 

Using census statistics from the ACS dataset, resulting calculated assigned variables are: Black Population %, White Population %, Indigenous American %, Asian  Population %, Hispanic or Latino Population %, % Below Poverty Line, % Housing Units Owned, % Housing Units Rented, % Mobile Homes, % Homes before 1980, % Homes after 1980, % With Complete Plumbing, % With Incomplete Plumbing, and % Foreign Born. This data is separated by region as well as collected nationally. Using regional and national averages for plumbing rates, a binary variable is calculated on whether plumbing is below or above the average.


```{r bianary creation and cleaning}
HOLC_polygons <- HOLC_polygons |>
  mutate(
    water_access = case_when(
      `ic_plumbE` > 2.61668 ~ 1,
      TRUE ~ 0
    )
  )#assigning a binary variable to plumbing access- 1 if the incomplete plumbing percentage is higher than the national average, 0 if it is lower than the national average. 





data_clean <- HOLC_polygons |>
  mutate(
    holc_id = area_id,
    holc_grade = grade,
    black_pct = (black_popE / total_pop_raceE) * 100,
    white_pct = (white_popE / total_pop_raceE) * 100,
    indig_pct = (ind_popE / total_pop_raceE) * 100,
    asian_pct = (asian_popE / total_pop_raceE) * 100,
    hispan_Latino_pct = (hisp_popE / total_pop_hispE) * 100,
    pct_below_poverty = (bp_popE / total_pop_plE) * 100,
    pct_home_ownership = (total_ownE / total_hu_tenE) * 100,
    pct_renters = (total_rentE / total_hu_tenE) * 100,
    pct_mobile_homes = (total_mhE / total_hu_mhE) * 100,
    pct_pre_1980 = ((age_1939E + age_1940E + age_1950E + age_1960E + age_1970E) / total_hu_ageE) * 100,
    pct_post_1980 = ((age_1980E + age_1990E + age_2000E + age_2010E + age_2014E) / total_hu_ageE) * 100,
    pct_complete_plumb = (c_plumbE / total_hu_plumbE) * 100,
    pct_incomplete_plumb = (ic_plumbE / total_hu_plumbE) * 100,
    water_access = water_access
  )

```

Data will now be verified using the supplementary tables by subtracting the national summary statistics table from the calculated table, which should result in zeros across the board. 

This is somewhat of a test of whether the authors actually did in fact use area weighted reaggregation or areal interpolation; if they used AWI, our results should more or less match, aside from the differing numbers of HOLC polygons remaining in the analysis. Additionally, because the reaggregation was done in a Python package this will test the similarities/differences of our implementation. 

The total number of observations in the summary statistics tables is 8878, 736 less than our AWI results. While we lost some  polygons through the scaling, the original authors, using a python package, lost many more than we did. It'll be interesting to see how different results are, as this is likely the cause of much of the potential difference between the datasets.

Then, use the Dunn Test in the to determine whether incomplete plumbing % in Grade A is significantly different than the other Grades and compared with supplementary table 1.

```{r dunn test}
library(rstatix)

Dunntest<- dunn_test(pct_incomplete_plumb ~ holc_grade, data = data_clean) #dunn test
Dunntest<-Dunntest|>
  mutate(
    Comparison = paste(group1, "-", group2),
    Z = statistic,
    P.unadj = p,
    P.adj = p.adj
  )|>
  dplyr::filter(group1 %in% c("A", "B","C", "D"))|>
  dplyr::select(Comparison, Z, P.unadj, P.adj)|>
  slice(2:3, 8, 5, 10, 14)

original_dunn_results<- read_csv(here("results","tables","original","table_s1.csv"))

test2<- (Dunntest[,2:4] - original_dunn_results[,2:4]) #subtracting for comparison
library(kableExtra)
kbl(test2) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) 
```

The dunn test result is extremely different, with the test Z statistic consistently negative in the original Dunn results and consistently positive, almost to the same degree. All of the pariwise differences are still statistically significant, which matches the findings of the original authors. 

Using a stepAIC function within the $MASS$ package and the HOLC Grade A as a reference group, we can gather a correlation table to remove the highest correlation values before our regression analysis. In this case, the highest correlation value will be removed to match the original methodology before being compared with supplementary table 2.




## Analysis

Sterling III's original study used a binary logistic regression model to compare categorical hold grades and a census block group's binary desigantion of whether plumbing rates were above or below average. Results were gathered as the Average Marginal Effects (AME) of different census-derived varaibles represented as binary values.

# Results

Data is presented as 3 figures, 2 tables, and 7 supplementary tables:

Figures:

- Map of HOLC grades for different cities across regions
- Correlation plot for potential predictive variables
- Map of percent of houses with incomplete plumbing  across regions

Tables:

- Average Marginal Effects of Variables determined by Binary Regression Model
- The Number of Each Grade Polygon in Each Data Set

Supplementary Tables:

- The results of the Dunn Test to determine whether incomplete plumbing % in Grade A is significantly different than the other Grades
- The average % for each predictive variable broken down by HOLC grade and region
- AME Table for the Nation using the average 2.61168 as the threshold for the binary variable

National Data Tables
- AME Table for the Northeast region using the average 1.447623 as the threshold for the binary variable
- AME Table for the South region using the average 3.414391 as the threshold for the binary variable
- AME Table for the Midwest region using the average 3.756471 as the threshold for the binary variable
- AME Table for the West region using the average 0.7836609 as the threshold for the binary variable

# Discussion

Sterling III hypothesizes that areas of present-day incomplete plumbing within U.S. cities (i.e., communities with a proportion of homes lacking complete plumbing above the national average) are significantly associated with HOLC neighborhood designations. The study finds evidence for this hypothesis.

A successful reproduction would confirm this hypothesis with similar derived values to those found in the original study.
